# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marco!

Already in my childhood I developed a great interest in **technology** and **computers**. In order to pursue this interest, I first completed my vocational baccalaureate with a focus on "computer science" and then began an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for **system integration**.

During my training, I found myself liking **design** and **programming** more and more, which is why I decided to further my education in these areas by studying after my training.

The choice fell on the **"Digital Media"** degree programme at Fulda University of Applied Sciences. In addition to programming languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP and SQL, topics such as media design, visualisation, audio and video processing and 3D modelling are covered.

During my studies, I was already able to successfully conceptualise, design and program applications and websites.
